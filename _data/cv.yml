    - title: Researcher
      institution: UCLA Computer Science
      year: 2022 - 2023
      description:
        - Supervisors - Prof. Kai-Wei Chang and Prof. Aditya Grover.
        - Objective - Defending multimodal contrastive learning models (e.g., CLIP) against backdoor attacks.
        - Demonstrated the effectiveness of combining multi-modal contrastive loss (e.g., CLIP) and uni-modal self-supervision loss (e.g., SimCLR) for fine-tuning on limited clean data, countering attacks while maintaining high downstream performance.

    - title: Researcher
      institution: Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems
      year: 2022 - Present
      description:
        - Supervisor - Dr. Wieland Brendel.
        - Objective - Develop a regularization approach for training neural networks that ensures each neuron aligns with a distinct semantic concept, thereby enhancing the mechanistic interpretability of deep neural networks.
        - We associate each neuron with a specific concept represented by a point in the CLIP embedding space. Then, we train the neural network to position highly activating images close to the concept descriptor within the CLIP embedding space.

    - title: Researcher
      institution: Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems
      year: 2021 - 2023
      description:
        - Supervisor - Prof. Falk Lieder.
        - Objective - Create a theoretical framework for setting subgoals that can assist individuals in achieving their objectives.
        - We use a computational model of human behavior to estimate how much a subgoal benefits individuals. Then, we use optimization methods to identify subgoals that optimize performance. Our subgoals improve performance in user studies.

    - title: Visiting Researcher
      institution: UCLA Statistics
      year: 2019
      description:
        - Supervisor - Prof. Tao Gao.
        - Objective - Learn policies for multi-agent adversarial games in MuJoCo using Deep Reinforcement Learning.
        - Implemented AlphaZero and benchmarked its performance against model-free, tree-search algorithms, and heuristic policies.

    - I enjoy singing and playing the guitar (and more recently, the ukulele). I was an active member of 'Mridang', the Indian music club of IIT Delhi, performing in and winning various events. Fun fact - as a kid, I was a finalist in a local TV reality singing show! 
    - I enjoy playing badminton and amateur photography. More recently, I have started enjoying running.
