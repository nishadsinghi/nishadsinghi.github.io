Hey! I'm Nishad. Thanks for stopping by, and welcome to my webpage! :)

I am a graduate student at the [University of T√ºbingen](https://www.neuroschool-tuebingen.de/) and the [Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems (MPI-IS)](https://is.mpg.de/).

I am passionate about understanding the computational principles underlying human üß† and machine ü§ñ intelligence, and applying them to build useful things for people. My research has been awarded the üèÜ [Best Paper Award](https://rtml-iclr2023.github.io/papers.html) at an ICLR 2023 workshop, and the [Diversity and Inclusion Award](https://cognitivesciencesociety.org/conference-awards/) at CogSci 2023.

During my time in T√ºbingen, I have been very fortunate to work in the labs of [Wieland Brendel](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=v-JL-hsAAAAJ&hl=en), [Zeynep Akata](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jQl9RtkAAAAJ&hl=en), [Kai-Wei Chang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fqDBtzYAAAAJ&hl=en), [Aditya Grover](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oOhnPUgAAAAJ&hl=en), [Falk Lieder](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JscQvlUAAAAJ&hl=en), [Kou Murayama](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=r0AJphIAAAAJ&hl=en), and [Michiko Sakaki](https://scholar.google.co.jp/citations?user=_mKkd00AAAAJ&hl=en).

Before this, I had a wonderful time as an undergraduate student at the [Indian Institute of Technology Delhi](https://home.iitd.ac.in/), where I had the fortune of working with [Sumeet Agarwal](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=vEsSCZsAAAAJ&hl=en), [Tapan Gandhi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=VyIA2PwAAAAJ&hl=en), and [Sumitava Mukherjee](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=gsrGTEQAAAAJ&hl=en).

Outside of work, I enjoy singing and playing the guitar, playing badminton, photography, and having good food (I am a massive masala dosa enthusiast!).

I'm always happy to meet new people. If you'd like to chat about anything/ collaborate, please reach out!
