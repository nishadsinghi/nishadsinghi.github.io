[**Resume**](https://nishadsinghi.github.io/assets/pdf/Nishad_CV_1pg.pdf)

Hey! I'm Nishad. Thanks for stopping by, and welcome to my webpage! :)

I'm an [ELLIS](https://ellis.eu) PhD student working with [Prof. Anna Rohrbach](https://anna-rohrbach.net/), [Prof. Marcus Rohrbach](https://rohrbach.vision/), and [Prof. Bernt Schiele](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/computer-vision-and-machine-learning/people/bernt-schiele/).

These days, I'm interested in multimodality, reasoning, and agents.

Before this, I've spent time working at the [Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems (MPI-IS)](https://is.mpg.de/) and [UCLA](https://ucla.edu). Along the way, I've had the fortune of working with some amazing mentors: [Kai-Wei Chang (UCLA)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fqDBtzYAAAAJ&hl=en), [Aditya Grover (UCLA)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oOhnPUgAAAAJ&hl=en), [Wieland Brendel (MPI-IS)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=v-JL-hsAAAAJ&hl=en), [Zeynep Akata (TU M√ºnich)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jQl9RtkAAAAJ&hl=en), and [Falk Lieder (UCLA)]([Falk Lieder](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JscQvlUAAAAJ&hl=en)). My research has been awarded the üèÜ [Best Paper Award](https://rtml-iclr2023.github.io/papers.html) at an ICLR 2023 workshop, and the [Diversity and Inclusion Award](https://cognitivesciencesociety.org/conference-awards/) at CogSci 2023.

Before this, I had a wonderful time as an undergraduate student at the [Indian Institute of Technology Delhi](https://home.iitd.ac.in/), where I had the fortune of working with [Sumeet Agarwal](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=vEsSCZsAAAAJ&hl=en), [Tapan Gandhi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=VyIA2PwAAAAJ&hl=en), and [Sumitava Mukherjee](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=gsrGTEQAAAAJ&hl=en).

Outside of work, I enjoy singing and playing the guitar, playing badminton, photography, and having good food (I am a massive masala dosa enthusiast!).

I'm always happy to meet new people. If you'd like to chat about anything/ collaborate, please reach out!
